This project focuses on the design, simulation, and verification of a simple Random Access Memory (RAM) using Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language). The entire design flow was implemented using the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite, a powerful FPGA development environment. The goal was to develop a functional memory module capable of storing and retrieving data through read and write operations, simulating how memory behaves inside a digital system or microprocessor A testbench was written to validate the RAM module. The testbench stimulated various scenarios, including writing to multiple addresses and reading from them to confirm the correct data was returned. The simulation also tested boundary conditions and incorrect write attempts to ensure the design was robust.
The simulation was executed using Vivado's Behavioral Simulation tool, where both the console outputs and waveforms were observed. The waveform analysis showed the timing of read and write operations aligned with the clock edges, confirming the correctness of synchronous operations.
The following steps were performed in Vivado:
Create a new RTL project
Add Verilog source files for RAM design and testbench
Run behavioral simulation
Analyze simulation results via waveform viewer
(Optional) Synthesize the design and generate bitstream for FPGA implementation
